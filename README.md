# Sailing website

This project is an integration for a sailing site which will soon be integrated into a Wordpress theme. It was developed using the Sass preprocessor and Webpack.

## Setup

**To set up the project, follow the steps below :**

1. Clone the repository

2. Move your current directory to the root of the project

3. Two choices are possible, you can launch the watcher of Sass to see the changes made on the project:

        npm start
        
   Or you can build the structure using Webpack:
   
        npm run build:dev
        npm run build:prod
        
**And it's done!**
